    # Fetch wallet data from the blockchain
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.nxai.com/wallet/{wallet_address}")
    wallet_data = response.json()
    
    # Example AI processing logic
    risk_score = calculate_risk_score(wallet_data)
    pnl = calculate_average_pnl(wallet_data)
    efficiency = calculate_trading_efficiency(wallet_data)
    
    return {
        "Risk Score": risk_score,
        "Average PNL": pnl,
        "Trading Efficiency": efficiency
    }

def calculate_risk_score(data):
    # Simplified risk score calculation
    trades = data.get("trades", [])
    losses = sum(1 for trade in trades if trade["pnl"] < 0)
    return 100 - (losses / len(trades)) * 100

# Example usage
wallet_address = "C7Lxj7naHeGcsM6X1XRNzwNcp971ojpTTvvYxNV4VBxS"
insights = analyze_wallet(wallet_address)
print(insights)
